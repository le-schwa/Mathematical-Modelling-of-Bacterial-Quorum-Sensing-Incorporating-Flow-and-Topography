# Mathematical Modelling of Macterial Quorum Sensing Incorporating Flow and Topography
Simulation of Quorum Sensing to replicate the findings of Kim et al. (see Minyoung Kevin Kim et al. Local and global consequences of flow on bacterial quorum sensing. Jan. 2016. url: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5010089/). ODEs, DDEs and Cellular Automata were utilized.
